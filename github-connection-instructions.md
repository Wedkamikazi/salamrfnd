# GitHub Repository Connection Instructions

## Current Environment Limitation

In this WebContainer environment, Git is not available as a command-line tool, so we cannot use standard Git commands to connect to your GitHub repository.

## Alternative Options for Connecting to GitHub

### Option 1: GitHub CLI 

If you have GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed on your local machine, you can:

1. Download a ZIP of this project from the browser
2. On your local machine, run:
   ```
   gh repo clone Wedkamikazi/salamrfnd
   cd salamrfnd
   # Extract the ZIP contents here, overwriting any existing files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Treasury Document Extractor application"
   git push
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Upload via GitHub Website

1. Go to your GitHub repository at: https://github.com/Wedkamikazi/salamrfnd
2. Click on the "Add file" dropdown button
3. Select "Upload files"
4. Download the project files from this environment and upload them to GitHub
5. Add a commit message like "Initial commit: Treasury Document Extractor application"
6. Click "Commit changes"

### Option 3: Use the GitHub Desktop Application

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Clone your repository: https://github.com/Wedkamikazi/salamrfnd
3. Download the project files from this environment
4. Copy the files into your cloned repository folder
5. Commit and push the changes using GitHub Desktop

## Additional Information

- Remember to include a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files
- If you encounter issues with large files, you may need to use GitHub's Large File Storage (LFS)
